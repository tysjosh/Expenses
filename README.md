# Expenses

A REST API from scratch using .NET Core, EF Core, AutoMapper, and XUnit for a small cost management system, including basic settings for authentication and access control. I will cover the whole business logic of the system with modular tests and create at least one integration test for each API method on an example of one entity.

Requirements for the developed system: The user can add, edit, delete his expenses and can see only their expenses.
